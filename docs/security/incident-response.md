   - Consider business impact
   - Determine response priority

3. **Activate Response Team**
   - Notify Incident Commander
   - Assemble appropriate team members
   - Establish communication channels

#### 1.3 Detailed Analysis (Within 1 hour)
1. **Evidence Collection**
   ```bash
   # Collect system logs
   journalctl -u cfscraper-api --since "1 hour ago" > incident-logs.txt
   
   # Collect audit logs
   grep "AUDIT" /var/log/cfscraper/audit.log > audit-evidence.txt
   
   # Collect network logs
   tcpdump -w incident-network.pcap
   ```

2. **Impact Assessment**

### Phase 2: Containment

#### 2.1 Short-term Containment (Immediate)
1. **Isolate Affected Systems**
   ```bash
   # Block suspicious IP addresses
   iptables -A INPUT -s SUSPICIOUS_IP -j DROP
   
   # Disable compromised API keys
   curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/v1/admin/api-keys/COMPROMISED_KEY_ID \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_API_KEY"
   ```

2. **Preserve Evidence**
   - Create system snapshots
   - Backup logs and data
   - Document all actions taken

3. **Prevent Spread**
   - Network segmentation
   - Access control updates
   - Service isolation

#### 2.2 Long-term Containment (Within 24 hours)
1. **System Hardening**
   - Apply security patches
   - Update configurations
   - Strengthen access controls

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Deploy additional monitoring
   - Increase log verbosity
   - Set up alerting

### Phase 3: Eradication

#### 3.1 Remove Threats (Within 48 hours)

   ```bash
   # Scan for malware
   clamscan -r /opt/cfscraper/
   
   # Remove identified threats
   rm -f /path/to/malicious/file
   ```

2. **Close Attack Vectors**
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Fix misconfigurations
   - Update security policies

3. **Account Cleanup**
   - Disable compromised accounts
