```

## API Changes

### New Endpoints Added

```
POST /api/v1/export/export          # Create new export
GET  /api/v1/export/download/{id}   # Download export file
GET  /api/v1/export/exports         # List available exports
DELETE /api/v1/export/export/{id}   # Delete export file
GET  /api/v1/export/formats         # Get supported formats
```

### Enhanced Responses

All API responses now include rate limiting headers:
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 45
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Basic Functionality Test

```bash
# Start the application
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Test basic scraping (should work as before)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/scrape/scrape" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://httpbin.org/html"}'
```

### 2. Proxy Rotation Test

```bash
# Configure proxies in environment
export PROXY_LIST='["http://proxy1:8080", "http://proxy2:3128"]'
export PROXY_ROTATION_STRATEGY="round_robin"

# Multiple requests should use different proxies
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/scrape/scrape" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"url": "https://httpbin.org/ip"}'
done
```

### 3. Rate Limiting Test

```bash
# Rapid requests should trigger rate limiting
for i in {1..70}; do
  curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/status"
done
# Should return 429 after hitting the limit
```

### 4. Data Export Test

```bash
# Create some jobs first, then export
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/export/export" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "format": "json",
    "compression": "gzip",
    "include_metadata": true
  }'
```

### 5. Webhook Test

```bash
# Set up a webhook endpoint (use webhook.site for testing)
# Register webhook and trigger job completion
```

### 6. Stealth Features Test

```bash
# Enable stealth mode and test detection bypass
export STEALTH_MODE_ENABLED=True
export STEALTH_INTELLIGENT_DELAYS=True

# Test with detection-heavy sites
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/scrape/scrape" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://bot-detection-test.com", "scraper_type": "selenium"}'
```

## Breaking Changes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è None - Fully Backward Compatible

This implementation is designed to be fully backward compatible:

- **All existing APIs** continue to work unchanged
- **Default configurations** maintain existing behavior
- **New features** are opt-in via configuration
- **Database schema** remains unchanged (uses existing tables + Redis)

### Migration Notes

1. **Redis Requirement**: Rate limiting requires Redis. If Redis is unavailable, the system gracefully falls back to allowing all requests.

2. **New Dependencies**: All required dependencies are already in `pyproject.toml`. No additional installation needed.

3. **Configuration**: All new features have sensible defaults and can be enabled gradually.

## Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts
- **Proxy rotation** improves success rates and reduces blocking
- **Rate limiting** protects against abuse and improves stability
- **Stealth features** reduce detection and improve scraping success
- **Intelligent delays** reduce server load on target sites

### Considerations
- **Redis dependency** for rate limiting (graceful fallback if unavailable)
- **Additional memory usage** for proxy tracking and webhook queues
- **Slight latency increase** due to stealth delays (configurable)

## Security Enhancements

- **HMAC signature verification** for webhooks
- **Rate limiting** prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- **Proxy authentication** support for secure proxy usage
- **Input validation** and sanitization throughout
- **Admin bypass tokens** for operational access

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Comprehensive logging** for all new components
- **Rate limit violation tracking** with alerting
- **Proxy health monitoring** with automatic failover
- **Webhook delivery analytics** with retry tracking
- **Export operation logging** with performance metrics
