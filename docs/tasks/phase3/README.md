## Phase 3 Overview: Advanced Features - Anti-Detection, Proxy Rotation, Data Export, Rate Limiting

Implement advanced scraping features including anti-detection mechanisms, proxy rotation, data export functionality, rate limiting, and webhook callbacks.

## Parent Issue

This is a sub-issue of #2 - Implement Comprehensive Scraper API Service with FastAPI, SeleniumBase, and Cloudscraper

## Tasks to Complete

### 1. Proxy Rotation and User-Agent Randomization

- [ ] Implement proxy pool management in `app/utils/proxy_manager.py`
- [ ] Create proxy rotation logic with health checking
- [ ] Add user-agent rotation with realistic browser fingerprints
- [ ] Implement proxy authentication and protocol support (HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS)
- [ ] Add proxy performance tracking and automatic failover
- [ ] Create configuration for proxy lists and rotation policies

### 2. Anti-Detection Mechanisms and Stealth Features

- [ ] Enhance SeleniumBase integration with stealth mode
- [ ] Implement request header randomization
- [ ] Add browser fingerprint randomization (window size, viewport, etc.)
- [ ] Create intelligent delay patterns between requests
- [ ] Implement cookie and session management
- [ ] Add JavaScript execution detection bypass
- [ ] Create captcha detection and handling framework

### 3. Data Export Functionality

- [ ] Implement JSON export with structured data formatting
- [ ] Add CSV export with customizable column mapping
- [ ] Create XML export with configurable schema
- [ ] Add data transformation and cleaning utilities
- [ ] Implement streaming export for large datasets
- [ ] Create compression options for exported files
- [ ] Add export scheduling and batch processing

### 4. Rate Limiting and Request Throttling

- [ ] Implement per-endpoint rate limiting with Redis
- [ ] Add IP-based rate limiting with configurable rules
- [ ] Create burst limiting for sudden traffic spikes
- [ ] Implement priority queuing for different user tiers
- [ ] Add rate limit headers and client feedback
- [ ] Create rate limit bypass for admin/internal requests
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting for rate limit violations

### 5. Webhook Callback System

- [ ] Implement webhook delivery system in `app/utils/webhooks.py`
- [ ] Add webhook signature verification for security
- [ ] Create retry logic for failed webhook deliveries
- [ ] Implement webhook payload customization
- [ ] Add webhook event filtering and subscription management
- [ ] Create webhook testing and debugging tools
- [ ] Add webhook delivery tracking and analytics

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
