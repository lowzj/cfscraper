## Phase 4 Overview: Production Readiness - Docker, Testing, Monitoring, Security, and Performance

Prepare the scraper API service for production deployment with Docker containerization, comprehensive testing, monitoring, security hardening, and performance optimization.

## Parent Issue

This is a sub-issue of #2 - Implement Comprehensive Scraper API Service with FastAPI, SeleniumBase, and Cloudscraper

## Tasks to Complete

### 1. Docker Containerization with Multi-Stage Builds

- [ ] Create optimized `Dockerfile` with multi-stage build for Python app
- [ ] Add `docker-compose.yml` for local development environment
- [ ] Create production `docker-compose.prod.yml` with Redis and PostgreSQL
- [ ] Implement health checks in Docker containers
- [ ] Add environment-specific configurations (.env files)
- [ ] Create Docker image optimization (minimal base image, layer caching)
- [ ] Add container security best practices (non-root user, read-only filesystem)

### 2. Comprehensive Unit and Integration Tests

- [ ] Add pytest configuration and test structure
- [ ] Create unit tests for all scraper classes (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Add database model tests with test fixtures
- [ ] Create job queue and background task tests
- [ ] Implement webhook delivery system tests
- [ ] Add proxy rotation and anti-detection feature tests
- [ ] Create performance tests for concurrent operations
- [ ] Add security tests for input validation and authentication

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting Capabilities

- [ ] Integrate Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] Add custom metrics for scraping success rates and performance
- [ ] Implement structured logging with JSON format
- [ ] Create health check endpoints for load balancer integration
- [ ] Add application performance monitoring (APM) integration
- [ ] Implement error tracking and notification system
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboard configuration (Grafana)
- [ ] Add alerting rules for critical system failures

### 4. Security Hardening

- [ ] Implement API key authentication for admin endpoints
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization for all endpoints
- [ ] Create rate limiting with IP whitelisting capabilities
- [ ] Implement secure configuration management (secrets handling)
- [ ] Add CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- [ ] Create security headers middleware (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- [ ] Implement request/response logging for audit trails
- [ ] Add vulnerability scanning and dependency checking

### 5. Performance Optimization and Load Testing

- [ ] Implement connection pooling for database and Redis
- [ ] Add async optimization for I/O bound operations
- [ ] Create memory usage optimization for large datasets
- [ ] Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Add database query optimization and indexing
- [ ] Create load testing scripts with realistic scenarios
- [ ] Implement auto-scaling configuration for containers
- [ ] Add performance profiling and bottleneck identification

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Docker containers start and run successfully in production
- [ ] All tests pass with >90% code coverage
- [ ] API can handle 100+ concurrent requests with <200ms response time
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable under load (<1GB per container)
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployment capability
- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring and alerting is operational
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities are identified and resolved
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet or exceed requirements
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate

## Performance Benchmarks

- **Response Time**: <100ms for job submission, <50ms for status checks
- **Throughput**: 1000+ requests per minute
- **Concurrent Jobs**: 50+ simultaneous scraping operations
- **Memory Usage**: <1GB per container instance
- **CPU Usage**: <50% under normal load
- **Success Rate**: >99% for job processing
- **Uptime**: 99.9% service availability

**Duration**: 1-2 weeks

## Dependencies

- Requires completion of Phase 3 (Advanced Features)
- Final phase before production deployment
