# Task 4: Security Hardening

## Overview
Implement comprehensive security measures including API authentication, input validation, rate limiting, secure configuration management, CORS, security headers, and vulnerability scanning.

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of Task 1 (Docker Containerization)
- Requires completion of Task 2 (Testing framework for security validation)
- Must have FastAPI application with all endpoints implemented

## Sub-Tasks (20-minute units)

### 4.1 Implement API Key Authentication
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Description**: Add API key authentication for admin and sensitive endpoints
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- API key generation and management system
- Authentication middleware for protected endpoints
- API key validation and expiration handling
- Different permission levels for different keys
- Secure API key storage and rotation

### 4.2 Input Validation and Sanitization
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Description**: Implement comprehensive input validation for all endpoints
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Pydantic models for all request/response validation
- SQL injection prevention measures
- XSS prevention in all user inputs
- File upload validation and sanitization
- URL and domain validation for scraping targets

### 4.3 Rate Limiting with IP Whitelisting
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Description**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Rate limiting middleware with configurable limits
- IP-based rate limiting with Redis backend
- IP whitelisting for trusted sources
- Rate limit headers in responses
- Graceful handling of rate limit exceeded

### 4.4 Secure Configuration Management
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Description**: Implement secure handling of secrets and configuration
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Environment variable validation on startup
- Secrets management integration (HashiCorp Vault or similar)
- Configuration encryption for sensitive data
- Secure default configurations
- Configuration audit logging

### 4.5 CORS Configuration
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Description**: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for secure API access
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- CORS middleware properly configured
- Allowed origins whitelist management
- Preflight request handling
- Credential handling configuration
- CORS policy documentation

### 4.6 Security Headers Middleware
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Description**: Implement security headers for web security best practices
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- X-Frame-Options for clickjacking prevention
- X-Content-Type-Options for MIME sniffing prevention
- Referrer-Policy for privacy protection

### 4.7 Request/Response Audit Logging
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Description**: Implement comprehensive audit logging for security monitoring
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All API requests logged with relevant details
- Authentication attempts and failures logged
- Sensitive data redaction in logs
- Log integrity and tamper protection
- Audit log retention and archival

### 4.8 Vulnerability Scanning and Dependency Checking
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Description**: Set up automated vulnerability scanning and dependency monitoring
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (safety, bandit)
- Container image vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis for security issues
- Automated security testing in CI/CD
- Security scan reporting and alerting

### 4.9 Data Encryption and Privacy
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Description**: Implement data encryption for sensitive information
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Database field encryption for sensitive data
- API response data encryption where needed
- Secure data transmission (HTTPS enforcement)
- Data anonymization for logs and analytics
- Privacy compliance measures (GDPR considerations)

### 4.10 Security Testing and Penetration Testing Setup
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Description**: Implement security testing framework and procedures
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Automated security test suite
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability tests
- Authentication and authorization tests
- Input validation security tests
- Security test reporting and documentation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All API endpoints properly authenticated and authorized
- [ ] Input validation prevents common attack vectors
- [ ] Rate limiting effectively prevents abuse
- [ ] Security headers properly configured
- [ ] Vulnerability scans show no critical issues
- [ ] Audit logging captures all security-relevant events
- [ ] Security tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Penetration testing identifies no critical vulnerabilities

## Security Targets
- Authentication response time: < 50ms
- Rate limiting accuracy: 99%+
- Vulnerability scan: 0 critical, < 5 medium issues
- Security test coverage: > 90% of endpoints
- Audit log completeness: 100% of security events
