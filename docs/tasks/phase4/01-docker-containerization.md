# Task 1: Docker Containerization with Multi-Stage Builds

## Overview
Create optimized Docker containers with multi-stage builds, health checks, security best practices, and environment-specific configurations for both development and production deployments.

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of Phase 3 (Advanced Features)
- Must have working FastAPI application with all core features

## Sub-Tasks (20-minute units)

### 1.1 Create Multi-Stage Dockerfile
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Description**: Design and implement an optimized Dockerfile with multi-stage build process
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Dockerfile uses multi-stage build (builder + runtime stages)
- Uses minimal base image (python:3.11-slim or alpine)
- Implements proper layer caching optimization
- Includes only necessary dependencies in final image
- Image size < 500MB

### 1.2 Implement Container Health Checks
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Description**: Add comprehensive health check mechanisms for container orchestration
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Health check endpoint implemented in FastAPI app
- Docker HEALTHCHECK instruction configured
- Health check validates database connectivity
- Health check validates Redis connectivity
- Returns proper HTTP status codes and response format

### 1.3 Configure Non-Root User and Security
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Description**: Implement container security best practices
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Container runs as non-root user
- Read-only filesystem where possible
- Proper file permissions set
- Security scanning passes (no critical vulnerabilities)
- Follows Docker security best practices

### 1.4 Create Development Docker Compose
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Description**: Set up local development environment with docker-compose
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- docker-compose.yml includes all services (app, redis, postgres)
- Volume mounts for live code reloading
- Environment variables properly configured
- Services can communicate with each other
- Easy startup with single command

### 1.5 Create Production Docker Compose
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Description**: Configure production-ready docker-compose setup
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- docker-compose.prod.yml optimized for production
- Includes reverse proxy/load balancer configuration
- Proper resource limits and constraints
- Production environment variables
- Restart policies configured

### 1.6 Environment Configuration Management
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Description**: Implement environment-specific configuration handling
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- .env.example file with all required variables
- .env.dev for development settings
- .env.prod template for production
- Configuration validation on startup
- Sensitive data properly handled (secrets)

### 1.7 Docker Image Optimization
**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Description**: Optimize Docker image for size and performance
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- .dockerignore file properly configured
- Multi-stage build removes build dependencies
- Image layers optimized for caching
- Build time < 5 minutes
- Final image size < 500MB

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Docker containers start successfully in both dev and prod modes
- [ ] All services can communicate properly
- [ ] Health checks pass consistently
- [ ] Container security scan shows no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Image build time is optimized
- [ ] Documentation includes setup and deployment instructions

## Performance Targets
- Container startup time: < 30 seconds
- Image build time: < 5 minutes
- Final image size: < 500MB
- Memory usage: < 512MB at startup

## Files to Create/Modify
- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- `.dockerignore`
- `.env.example`
- `.env.dev`
- `docs/deployment/docker-setup.md`
